" ==================== Common Vim/Neovim Key Mappings ====================
" These mappings are shared by both Vim and Neovim.
" They rely on <Leader> being set to space (see core template).

nnoremap <Leader>w :w<CR>       " Save file
nnoremap <Leader>q :q<CR>       " Quit
nnoremap <Leader>x :x<CR>       " Save and quit
nnoremap <Leader>e :Explore<CR>  " Open file explorer (netrw)

" Add more common mappings here...
